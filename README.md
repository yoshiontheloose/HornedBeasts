## Gallery of Horns

By the end of this week, you will create an application that displays images and information of horned animals. This application will allow you to filter the images by number of horns and chose your favorite image.

Today we will just be focusing on the component structure of the application. You will create a new React application using create-react-app and fill it with components. Refer to ‘Feature Tasks’ to see exactly which components to build and where to display them.
